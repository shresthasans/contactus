## Unique HTML5 & CSS3 - Contact Us Page

### Getting Started

 1. Open `CMD`, go to folder where you store the projects file. Don't create folder for this project yet.
 2. `git` `clone` `https://github.com/shresthasans/contactus`
 3. It will create *gulp-fe-dev* folder and donwload all codes from Github.

*Once you have downloaded, follow below steps to restore all dependencies and project structure:*

 1. In the same CMD, run `cd contactus`
 2. Next, run `npm i` (`i` stands for `install`)
 3. Run `bower install`
 
Now, run `gulp` from same CMD window. It will open the project server: `http://localhost:7010/`

Continue working, as soon as you save - it will compile CSS, and Refresh HTML too.
